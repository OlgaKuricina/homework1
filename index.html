    <h3 style="color:brown"> History of a Swedish cinnamon bun </h3>
    <p>A cinnamon bun (<em>en kanelbulle</em>) can be traced back to 1920, when people in Sweden started to recover
    from the 1st World War. With the income levels rising, some Swedes could now afford to buy luxurious ingredients
like cinnamon, butter, spices, and bake these indulgent sweet pastries. However, it was not until 1950s that a kanelbulle
became a national symbol of the country. Many years later, a cinnamom bun becames a beloved symbol of Sweden that people are proud of
and that brings back nostalgic memories of cold winter evenings of childhood.</p>
    <p>In 1999 Sweden's Home Baking Council (yes, it is a thing) established a the National Cinnamon Bun Day, which
        is celebrated on 4th October throughout the country. On that day, around seven million buns are sold in Sweden
        in cafes and bakeries. The statistics do not include the amount of buns being baked at homes, therefore the overall 
        number is even higher. On regular days, 57% of Swedes are believed to eat at least one bun a day
    </p>
    <p>Cinnamon Bun is also central piece in a peculiar tradition called <em>fika</em>, which refers 
        to a tea/coffee break at around 3pm to enjoy a cup of hot drink with a piece of freash pastry with 
        friends or colleagues. One can have fika either at a cafe or straigh at the workplace. Employers treat
    their employees to a selection of pastries and freshly brewed drinks. The tradition means more than just eating baked goods
    and drinking tea, but gathering with people and taking a moment to enjoy stillness and catch up on the topics that are 
    not related to work. No wonder Swedish people are considered to be one of the most happy nations in the world. </p>
